  - Plugin approval persistence with content-hash invalidation

- **Skills System**
  - Domain expertise via markdown files with YAML frontmatter
  - Auto-matching via trigger keywords

  - Built-in skills: pptx-expert, web-scraper, research-synthesiser, data-processor, report-builder, api-explorer

- **Patterns System**
  - Code generation templates for common tasks
  - Built-in patterns: two-handler-pipeline, file-generation, fetch-and-process, data-transformation, data-extraction, image-embed

- **Resource Profiles**
  - Bundled limit and plugin presets
  - Stackable profiles (max limits, union of plugins)

- **Module System**
  - Built-in modules: str-bytes, crc32, base64, xml-escape, deflate, zip-format, ooxml-core, pptx, pptx-charts, pptx-tables
  - User-defined modules persisted to ~/.hyperagent/modules/
  - Shared state across handler recompiles via ha:shared-state

- **Code Validation**
  - Pre-execution validation in isolated Rust guest (hyperlight-analysis-guest)
  - QuickJS parser for syntax checking
  - Import validation against available modules
  - Plugin source scanning for dangerous patterns

- **CLI Features**
  - Non-interactive mode with `--prompt` and `--auto-approve`
  - Slash commands for runtime configuration
  - Command suggestions extracted from LLM output
  - Ctrl+R reverse history search
  - Session transcript recording

### Security

- Hardware isolation via Hyperlight micro-VMs (KVM/MSHV/WHP)
- Tool gating blocks all SDK built-in tools (bash, edit, grep, read, write)
- LLM-based plugin security auditing with anti-prompt-injection canaries
- Code validation before execution in isolated sandbox
- Path jailing for filesystem plugins
- SSRF protection for fetch plugin (DNS + post-connect IP validation)
