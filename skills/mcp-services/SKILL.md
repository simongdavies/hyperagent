antiPatterns:
  - Don't try to manage_plugin("mcp:<name>") — MCP servers are NOT regular plugins
  - Don't import from "host:mcp-gateway" — that's the gateway sentinel, not a server
  - Don't guess tool names — always call mcp_server_info() first
  - Don't hardcode MCP tool schemas — they change when servers update

  - list_mcp_servers
  - mcp_server_info
  - manage_mcp

## MCP Server Workflow

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide external tool capabilities — M365
services, GitHub, databases, custom APIs. Follow this exact workflow:

### Step 1: Discover configured servers

```
list_mcp_servers()
```

Returns all configured servers with their state (`idle`, `connected`, `error`).
Each server has a name like `work-iq-mail`, `work-iq-teams`, `github`, etc.

### Step 2: Connect the server you need

```
manage_mcp({ action: "connect", name: "work-iq-mail" })
```

- If pre-approved → connects silently
- If not approved → prompts the user for approval (shows tools + security info)
- Returns `{ success: true, tools: [...], module: "host:mcp-<name>" }`

### Step 3: Get tool schemas

```
mcp_server_info("work-iq-mail")
```

Returns full JSON Schema for every tool plus TypeScript declarations. Read this
BEFORE writing handler code — tool names and parameter shapes vary per server.

### Step 4: Use the tools in handler code

```javascript
import { SearchEmails } from "host:mcp-work-iq-mail";

export default async function handler(event) {
  const result = await SearchEmails({ query: "from:boss subject:urgent" });
  return { content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(result) }] };
}
```

Key rules:
- Import from `host:mcp-<server-name>` (the name from list_mcp_servers)
- Tool function names are EXACTLY as returned by mcp_server_info
- All MCP tool calls are async — use `await`
- Tools return `{ content: [{type, text}] }` — parse the text field as needed
- Some servers return embedded JSON (status text + JSON) — extract the JSON part

### Server name patterns

M365 servers use the `work-iq-` prefix:
- `work-iq-mail` — Email (search, send, reply, drafts)
- `work-iq-teams` — Teams (channels, chats, messages)
- `work-iq-calendar` — Calendar (events, scheduling)
- `work-iq-planner` — Planner (tasks, plans)
- `work-iq-sharepoint` — SharePoint (files, sites)
- `work-iq-onedrive` — OneDrive (personal files)
- `work-iq-copilot` — M365 Copilot (natural language queries)

Other servers use their own names (e.g. `github`, `filesystem`).

### Error handling

- If `manage_mcp` returns `success: false` — the user denied approval or
  auth failed. Tell the user what happened.
- If a tool call fails — check `lastError` in `list_mcp_servers()` output.
- OAuth servers may prompt for browser auth on first connect — this is normal.

### Multiple servers in one task

You can connect multiple servers in sequence:

```
manage_mcp({ action: "connect", name: "work-iq-mail" })
manage_mcp({ action: "connect", name: "work-iq-calendar" })
```

Then use tools from both in a single handler.
